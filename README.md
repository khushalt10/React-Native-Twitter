üìã Requirements React Native apps may target iOS 10.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like Expo can be used to work around this.

üéâ Building your first React Native app Follow the Getting Started guide. The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:
